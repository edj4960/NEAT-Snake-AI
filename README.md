# NEAT-Snake-AI
Snake AI using the NEAT method.

Network follows the following structure:
Genome Handler -> Species -> Genome -> Bond -> Node

This method creates species of similar networks and breeds them to make new networks to be tested. 
The overall fitness of each network determines the amount of offspring they have.

Also contains a partially working Network printer that is meant to display what each network looks like.
